Implementing the k-means and k-medians clustering algorithm.

Requirements: Python 3.0 or later
Libraries used: Numpy, Matplotlib and Pandas

To run this code, user must have files: fruits, countries, veggies and animals in the same folder as the .py file. (Or read the file via path)

In this code:
K means and K medians clustering are implemented to cluster the data from all data files fruits, countries, veggies and animals.
Each clustering is run with K values 1-9, returning the B-CUBED precision, recall and F score.
Results are plotted on graphs with k in the horizontal axis and the B-CUBED precision, recall and F-score in the vertical axis in the same plot.
